# CitiBike-Challenge

Citi Bike is the nation's largest bikeshare program, with 25,000 bikes and over 1,500 stations across New York city (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, Jersey City, and Hoboken). For a practical visualization of the citi bike information, a dashboard has been created in Tableau, which you can access through the following link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ivan.corona/viz/CitiBike_Dashboard_17072609622780/Historia1?publish=yes

The objective of creating the dashboard is to address two main topics: A general report of the main statistics from November 2023 to January 2024. And, study the main metrics of our types of customers (members and casual customers). The most outstanding conclusions are presented below:

1) In the first dashboard we address the most relevant information about our stations and the number of trips in each of them. First of all, we want to visualize the number of trips per month, where most of them were in November. December and January were below and thats probably because the snow conditions, where people prefer to take a bus or subway instead. Of course we visualize on a map each location station with its relevant information, like Latitude, Longitude, Station name and number of starting trips. Then, it is important
to see the top 5 stations for starting a trip and the top 5 stations for ending a trip. Surprisingly, the following stations appear in both scenarios:
- Hoboken Terminal - River St & Hudson
- Grove St Path
- Hoboken Terminal Hudson St & Hudson PI
- Bergen Ave & Sip Ave
- Newport Path

Finally, we show the number of trips by weekday. Unexpectedly, the weekend days are not the most days with trips but Wednesday and then Thursday.
  
2) For our second dashboard we focus on our customers type. In the results, both types of customers use more often classic bikes than electric bikes. One similarity is that both casual customers and members use bike trips mostly at 5 p.m and then at 8 a.m On the other hand, an average trip duration for casual customers is much longer than the members trips. And December 25th was a very special day, where the average trip was around 40min for casual customers.

Finally, we decided to visualize the top 3 lcoations for starting a trip, Hoboken Terminal River St & Hudson PI is one of them for both, but casual customers usually start a trip at the 11 St & Washington St. probably would be a strategically location to get more people to become a member customer.
